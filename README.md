This is a replacement board for the DEC8251 chip.

It is based on the not pincompatible SN7442. Before using check if the
pins 6 and 7 of the original DEC8251 are not in use. The 7442 truth table
is slightly different for the higher (forbidden) decoded lines.
In most of the PDP8 applicatins this replacement can be used.
